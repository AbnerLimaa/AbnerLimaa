### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Abner Lima and i'm a computer scientist working on a bunch of projects for some companies. I have some open source repositories on GitHub where you can see projects made for college courses. 

When I have free time I usually start coding applications for Virtualsoft. I think this is a good strategy to earn money and avoid procrastination.

ðŸ“« How to reach me: send me a letter at abner.lima27@outlook.com
